Apache Pig is a high-level data processing platform that runs on Hadoop.It is designed to handle large datasets efficiently using parallel processing.
The scripting language used in Apache Pig is called Pig Latin.Pig Latin provides a simple, SQL-like syntax for writing data analysis programs. 
Apache Pig is commonly used for ETL tasks, data transformation, and analysis.Apache Pig acts as an abstraction layer over Hadoop’s MapReduce framework.
It enables developers to write fewer lines of code for complex data workflows.Pig Latin scripts are automatically optimized and converted into MapReduce jobs.
