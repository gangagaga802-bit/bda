CREATE INTO frequency.txt —--TEXT EDITOR
MapReduce is a parallel computing paradigm and software framework for processing large datasets across many computers, designed for tasks like data extraction, transformation, and loading. It works by dividing the job into two key phases: "Map" and "Reduce"


INSERT INTO mapper3.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys


# Read input line by line
for line in sys.stdin:
    line = line.strip()  # Remove leading/trailing whitespaces


    words = line.split()  # Split the line into words
    for word in words:
        print(f"{word}\t1")  # Emit word and count (tab-separated)

INSERT INTO  reducer.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys


word_counts = {}  # Dictionary to store word counts


# Read input from mapper
for line in sys.stdin:
    word, count = line.strip().split("\t")  # Split word and count
    count = int(count)  # Convert count to integer


    # Aggregate counts
    if word in word_counts:
        word_counts[word] += count
    else:
        word_counts[word] = count


# Print final word frequencies
for word, count in word_counts.items():
    print(f"{word}\t{count}")
